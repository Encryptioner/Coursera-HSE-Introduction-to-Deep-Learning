# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Requirements

1. Python 3.6 

## Installation (For Ubuntu 18.04 - Virtual Environment - Offline)

1. Run `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`
2. Run `sudo pip3 install virtualenv` 
3. Run `virtualenv ENVIRONMENT_NAME`. You can Run it in your home/project directory. It will be then operated from there.
4. To active find `.virtualenvs` folder & run `source ENVIRONMENT_NAME/bin/activate`. You will get shell.
5. You also can run `workon ENVIRONMENT_NAME` to get the shell.
6. To install requirement packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. To install packages run `pip3 install <some-package>`
8. Run your project in virtual environment when you are in IDE.
9. To deactivate run `deactivate` on the shell.
